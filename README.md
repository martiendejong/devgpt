# DevGPT

DevGPT is an agentic framework for .NET that lets you build, run, and orchestrate AI agents over your own documents and source code. It combines retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG), tool calling, and safe file modifications so agents can search, read, reason, and update your repositories with context.

It ships with:
- A set of core libraries (also packaged for NuGet) for embeddings, document stores, tool contexts, LLM client wrappers, and agent orchestration.
- A Windows desktop app to author Stores, Agents, and Flows, and to chat with them.
- Sample utilities (EmbeddingsViewer, Crosslink, PDFMaker, HtmlMockupGenerator) demonstrating the building blocks in practical scenarios.

## What This Tool Is For

DevGPT helps you create autonomous or semi‑autonomous AI agents that can:
- Index your documents and code into lightweight, local embedding stores.
- Find the most relevant files for a prompt and feed them to an LLM.
- Call developer‑oriented tools (e.g., `git`, `dotnet`, `npm`), data tools (e.g., Google BigQuery), and custom tools.
- Modify files deterministically through a strongly typed “update store” response format.
- Collaborate via multi‑agent “flows,” where agents call other agents and exchange context.

Common use cases:
- Code assistants that read/update local repositories with explicit write permissions per store.
- Knowledge assistants that answer questions using your docs, knowledge base, or customer data.
- Data helpers that explore and query datasets (e.g., BigQuery) and synthesize insights.

## High‑Level Architecture

Core concepts:
- Stores: A `DocumentStore` combines a text store (files), an embedding store (vectors), and a parts store (chunk index). Stores are named, can be read‑only or writable, and power RAG.
- Agents: A `DevGPTAgent` pairs a `DocumentGenerator` (LLM + RAG) with a `ToolsContextBase` (tool calls). Agents are configured with a system prompt, a set of stores, and an allowed toolset.
- Flows: A `DevGPTFlow` is a lightweight orchestration over agents. A flow describes which agents can be called in sequence or on demand.
- LLM Client: `ILLMClient` abstracts LLM providers. `DevGPT.OpenAI` provides an OpenAI implementation (chat, streaming, images, embeddings).
- Tools: Tool definitions (functions + typed parameters) the model can call during a conversation. Tools are attached to an agent via its `ToolsContextBase`.

Key libraries and roles:
- DevGPT.Classes: Shared contracts (chat messages, tool calls, typed responses like `UpdateStoreResponse`).
- DevGPT.Helpers: Utilities (document splitting, partial JSON parser, token counting, checksum, store helpers).
- DevGPT.EmbeddingStore: Embedding backends (file‑based and in‑memory) with a simple JSON format.
- DevGPT.DocumentStore: `DocumentStore` composition + RAG helpers (relevant items, listing, move/remove, etc.).
- DevGPT.LLMClient: The provider‑agnostic LLM interface.
- DevGPT.OpenAI: Concrete OpenAI implementation (chat, streaming, images, embeddings) + response parsing.
- DevGPT.LLMClientTools: Tool context abstraction and helper tools (e.g., `WebPageScraper`).
- DevGPT.Generator: `DocumentGenerator` that assembles messages with relevant context and can safely apply file updates.
- DevGPT.AgentFactory: Agent/store/flow creation, config format helpers, built‑in toolsets (read/write/list/relevancy, git/dotnet/npm/build, BigQuery, email, WordPress placeholder).

Applications:
- Windows: WPF app to author Stores/Agents/Flows (as text or cards) and chat with selected agent/flow.
- EmbeddingsViewer: WPF tool to inspect `.embed` files and list their keys.
- Crosslink: Console sample showing semantic matching of a CV to job postings using stores.
- PDFMaker, HtmlMockupGenerator: Samples that show how to compose DevGPT components.

## Configuration: Stores, Agents, Flows

DevGPT supports both JSON and a simple `.devgpt` text format for configuration. The Windows app can edit either format. At runtime, the loader auto‑detects the format.

Examples:

stores.devgpt
```
Name: devgpt_sourcecode
Description: Alle projectcode, inclusief tests, CI/CD scripts, infra en devopsconfiguraties.
Path: C:\Projects\DevGPT
FileFilters: *.cs,*.ts,*.js,*.py,*.sh,*.yml,*.yaml,*.json,*.csproj,*.sln,Dockerfile
SubDirectory: 
ExcludePattern: bin,obj,node_modules,dist
```

agents.devgpt
```
Name: devgpt_simpleagent
Description: 
Prompt: Handle the instruction.
Stores: devgpt_sourcecode|False
Functions: 
CallsAgents: 
CallsFlows: 
ExplicitModify: False
```

Key fields:
- Store `Write` flag: controls whether an agent may call write/delete tools on that store.
- Functions: opt‑in to tool sets (e.g., `git`, `dotnet`, `npm`, `build`, `bigquery`, `email`, `wordpress`, `custom`).
- CallsAgents/CallsFlows: allow cross‑agent or flow invocations from within an agent.

---

## How Responses Are Generated

`DocumentGenerator` assembles the LLM message list as:
- Recent conversation history (sliding window).
- Retrieved relevant document snippets from the agent’s writable store plus any extra read‑only stores.
- A list of files in the writable store (optional, provides global context).
- The agent’s system prompt and the user input.

Agents can request tool calls (e.g., list/read files, search by relevancy, run `git`/`dotnet`/`npm`, query BigQuery). The OpenAI wrapper handles tool streaming and merges tool outputs back into the conversation.

For safe code changes, the model is asked to respond in the strongly typed `UpdateStoreResponse` shape. DevGPT parses and applies:
- Modifications: write updated file contents.
- Deletions: remove files.
- Moves: rename files.

This enforces full‑file writes and avoids “partial edits” that would yield broken code.

---

## Windows App (WPF)

The Windows app lets you:
- Open/edit/save Stores, Agents, and Flows (as text or card views).
- Start a chat window bound to an agent or flow.
- See interim tool output messages and final replies.

Required settings:
- OpenAI API key and model selection are read from `appsettings.json` (see OpenAIConfig below).
- Some tools (e.g., BigQuery) require credentials (`googleaccount.json` next to the app executable).

---

## OpenAI Configuration

`DevGPT.OpenAI` reads configuration via `OpenAIConfig`:

appsettings.json
```
{
  "OpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": "sk-...",
    "Model": "gpt-4.1",
    "ImageModel": "gpt-image-1",
    "EmbeddingModel": "text-embedding-ada-002",
    "LogPath": "C:\\projects\\devgptlogs.txt"
  }
}
```

Or construct `OpenAIConfig` in code and pass it to `OpenAIClientWrapper`.

---

## Using DevGPT In Your Code

Minimal agent from code:
```
var openAI = new OpenAIConfig(apiKey);
var llm = new OpenAIClientWrapper(openAI);

var store = new DocumentStore(
    new EmbeddingFileStore(@"C:\\myproj\\repo.embed", llm),
    new TextFileStore(@"C:\\myproj"),
    new DocumentPartFileStore(@"C:\\myproj\\repo.parts"),
    llm);
await store.UpdateEmbeddings();

var baseMsgs = new List<DevGPTChatMessage> {
  new DevGPTChatMessage { Role = DevGPTMessageRole.System, Text = "You are a helpful assistant." }
};
var generator = new DocumentGenerator(store, baseMsgs, llm, new List<IDocumentStore>());
var tools = new ToolsContextBase();

// Optional: add read tools for the store
// (See AgentFactory.AddReadTools for reference or use AgentFactory directly)

var agent = new DevGPTAgent("assistant", generator, tools);
var reply = await agent.Generator.GetResponse("What files relate to authentication?", default);
```

Using configuration files via AgentManager:
```
var mgr = new AgentManager(
  storesJsonPath: "stores.devgpt",
  agentsJsonPath: "agents.devgpt",
  flowsJsonPath:  "flows.devgpt",
  openAIApiKey: apiKey,
  logFilePath:   "C:\\logs\\devgpt.log");
await mgr.LoadStoresAndAgents();
var response = await mgr.SendMessage("Explain how build works", default, agentName: "devgpt_simpleagent");
```

## Proposal: Radically Improve Quality and Usability

Focus areas and actions per main library (NuGet packages):

DevGPT.Classes
- Stabilize public API with XML docs and examples.
- Add analyzers and nullable annotations consistently across types.
- Provide consistent naming (DevGPTChatMessage, DevGPTChatTool, etc.).

DevGPT.Helpers
- Extract token counting and parsing into cohesive namespaces.
- Harden `PartialJsonParser` with formal streaming/JSON repair strategies and tests.
- Add benchmarks for splitter/token counter to tune defaults.

DevGPT.EmbeddingStore
- Unify file format, add schema version, and safe persistence (temp + atomic replace).
- Add compaction and integrity verification commands.
- Expose asynchronous batch APIs for indexing.

DevGPT.DocumentStore
- Enforce consistent path normalization, case rules, and separators.
- Add transactional update API for multi‑file edits and rollbacks on failure.
- Provide adapters for alternative storage (e.g., SQLite/Faiss/PGVector via plugin pattern).

DevGPT.LLMClient
- Keep provider‑neutral with explicit capabilities (chat, stream, tools, images, embeddings).
- Add retry/backoff and rate‑limit policies in the abstraction (pluggable strategies).
- Introduce cancellation guidance and timeouts per call.

DevGPT.OpenAI
- Centralize model configuration and safety prompts per operation.
- Improve streaming tool‑call assembly and error surfaces (clear exceptions when partial tool data is malformed).
- Add structured logging hooks, correlation IDs, and redaction utilities.

DevGPT.LLMClientTools
- Formalize a Tool Provider pattern to register tool sets (fs, git, dotnet, npm, http, webscrape, email, bigquery) with discovery and capability flags.
- Add input validation and guardrails for each tool (timeouts, allowlists, working dirs).
- Provide mocks/fakes for offline tests.

DevGPT.Generator
- Refactor message assembly pipeline into pluggable “message enrichers” (history window, relevant snippets, file list, extra stores) with ordering and limits.
- Expose safe policies for UpdateStore (e.g., max file size, extension allowlist, diff preview mode).
- Add optional dry‑run and patch preview generation.

DevGPT.AgentFactory
- Separate config parsing from construction; expose typed validation with diagnostics.
- Remove hardcoded paths; inject `IClock`, `IFileSystem` to ease testing.
- Make tool sets explicitly opt‑in by name and document them in generated schema.

Cross‑cutting
- Add unit and integration tests throughout; create small sample repos for repeatable tests.
- Add CI (build, test, package) and publish signed NuGet packages.
- Provide sandboxes and safety defaults (no write tools unless explicitly configured).
- Write end‑to‑end samples: “Code Assistant,” “Docs Q&A,” “Data Analyst with BigQuery.”

---

## What’s Needed For VS Developer Usability

To make DevGPT drop‑in for typical Visual Studio projects:
- Publish NuGet packages with semantic versioning and clear release notes.
- Provide QuickStart templates/snippets for common scenarios (one‑agent, multi‑agent flow, RAG only).
- Ship a minimal `AgentManager` bootstrapper with JSON config support out‑of‑the‑box.
- Document `appsettings.json` for OpenAIConfig and environment variable overrides.
- Provide a sample `stores.devgpt`/`agents.devgpt` for a standard .NET solution.
- Offer a “no‑write by default” configuration with clear steps to enable safe writes.
- Add a `DevGPT.Tools.FileSystem` module with explicit root allowlists and path guards for Windows/Linux.
- Ensure all public APIs target `net8.0` and consider `netstandard2.1` where feasible for wider reuse.
- Provide a Visual Studio “Connected Service” or item template for adding DevGPT quickly (optional).

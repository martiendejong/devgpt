# Summary of main logic added to MainWindow.xaml.cs

This update enables reading and displaying the contents of `stores.json` and `agents.json` in the application with DataGrid editing and saving changes:

- Two new ObservableCollections (`_storesList` and `_agentsList`) track the deserialized content of these files.
- Load buttons for each file prompt the user and load the JSON, showing it in a tabbed DataGrid.
- Save buttons serialize the in-memory objects back to their source file.
- Edits in the DataGrid reflect changes in the bound ObservableCollection.
- Model classes for StoreConfig, AgentConfig, and StoreRef are included for context.
- Error handling is added for file IO/serialization issues.

UI in `MainWindow.xaml` is updated to use a `TabControl` with editable `DataGrid`s and `Save` buttons.
